# Assignment 1 – Personal Portfolio 

Here is a simple personal portfolio website I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Main Features
My portfolio includes the following:
- Main sections:
	- About Me
	- Projects 
	- Skills
	- Contact sections
- Responsive web design for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.
- Basic JavaScript interactivity:
  - Dark/Light theme 
  - Smooth Scrolling
  - Contact form (no active backend interaction in the meantime)

## Folder Structure
Clear structure of the files ordered in this repository:

| File Name | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | Main page (where the program should run in) |
| `css/styles.css` | For page styling |
| `js/script.js` | For functionality  |
| `assets/images/` | Project images |
| `docs/ai-usage-report.md` | A detailed AI usage report |
| `docs/technical-documentation.md` | Technical documentation |


## Setup 
1. Clone the repository into an editor (VS Code is highly recommended)
2. Open `index.html` and run it in your browser  


## AI Use Report (Short Summary)  - CHECK?
I used AI tools to help draft the initial layout, improve responsive CSS structure, and review JavaScript logic. Full details are documented in `docs/ai-usage-report.md`.
