# Assignment 1 – Personal Portfolio 

Here is a simple personal portfolio website I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description
This project is a personal portfolio website built as part of the first assignment. The purpose of the website is to present personal information, projects, skills, and contact details in a professional format. It is designed as a single-page application with multiple sections connected using internal navigation links on the top of the page. The website follows a modern web development practices by separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior/functionality (JS).


## Main Features
My portfolio includes the following:
- Main sections:
	- About Me: A short description about me
	- Projects: 3 projects I worked on
	- Skills: Professional and Programming skills
	- Contact Form 
- Responsive web design for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.
- Basic JavaScript interactivity:
  - Dark/Light theme 
  - Smooth Scrolling
  - Contact form (no active backend interaction in the meantime)

## Folder Structure
Clear structure of the files ordered in this repository:

| File Name | Usage |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Main page (where the program should run in) |
| `css/styles.css` | For page styling |
| `js/script.js` | For functionality  |
| `assets/images/` | Project images |
| `docs/ai-usage-report.md` | A detailed AI usage report |
| `docs/technical-documentation.md` | Technical documentation |


## Setup 
1. Clone the repository into an editor (VS Code is highly recommended)
2. Open `index.html` and run it in your browser  


## AI Use Report (Short Summary)  - CHECK?
I used AI tools to help draft the initial layout, improve responsive CSS structure, and review JavaScript logic. Full details are documented in `docs/ai-usage-report.md`.
