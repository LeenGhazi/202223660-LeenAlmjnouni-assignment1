        <h3>Project 2: Peruke Game"</h3>
        <p>A multiplayer strategy game developed using Python and Tkinter that challenges 2 players to make smart decisions using dice-based mechanics and 6 discs for each player. Players can win the game by strategically flip their discs and collect points to win. This project focuses on game logic in calculating the points, user interface design, and interactive gameplay.</p>
