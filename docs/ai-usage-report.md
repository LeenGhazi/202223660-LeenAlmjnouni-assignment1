# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used
- VS Code generator:
	- Using VS chat toggle to generate the structure of the HTML code (especially for dividing and wrapping sections)
	- Debugging and code review
	- Using Markdown preview for edit and style my report
- ChatGPT:
  - Generating an initial project layout 
	  - HTML sectioning
	  - CSS layout 
	  - JS functionality
  - Asking for suggestion to improve the design in terms of colors/theme/styling in general
  - Reviewing code and checking if the comments clearly explain each part in my code
  - drafting the readme file report

All AI tools mentioned above were used as a support systems. All code was manually reviewed and tested particularly in styling.


## Benefits & Challenges

**Benefits**
AI tools significantly improved my work in:
- Initializing a draft of the assignment structure (e.g., sections, folder layout).
- Understanding the assignments requirement and check if all the required features are included.
- Great debugging assistant feature especially for syntax errors.
- Improving documentation quality for my reports.
- Exploring more professional styling features.
- Compare my work to the rubric and identify missing items.


**Challenges / Limitations**

A few challenges I faced during my AI-usage in this assignment:
- Manual code testing when it comes to visualize specific styles.
- Matching modified classes in HTML and CSS codes.
- Focusing on the optional features and page styling rather than the required one.
- Code originality and verification with the academic integrity guidelines.

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this assignments taught me the following:
- Structuring a personal website from the scratch.
- Applying Grid style for devices adaptability.
- Understanding the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS as each one is responsible  for structuring, styling, and functionality respectively.
- Visualizing difference styles and rules override especially in changing the page theme.
- Verifying AI generating codes and analyse the result instead of copying the entire code.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

In order to manage academic integrity in this assignment, I did the following:
- Reviewing every code snippet generated by AI line-by-line and find where and how it can be integrated into my original code.
- Providing the contents added in my current website.
- Manually designing and styling my website page to match my goals and preferences.
- Testing my code after every modification or any code added to check if it's correct using VS Code Editor.
- Regularly updating my code through my assignment repository in github.
- Writing comments and removing unnecessary/unused features in all 3 codes files manually and explain how each function is connected to other part of the code in another file.
- Ensuring I met all the requirements in this assignments and reflect on the features I have learned in this process.
