## 1. Technologies Used

### 1.1 HTML
HTML is used to structure the website content such as sections, headings, paragraphs, images, and form elements. Main elements used:
- sections, headers, paragraphs, links
- images and image containers
- anchor links for navigation

### 1.2 CSS3
CSS is mainly for visualizing the appearance and layout of the website. Main elements used:
- Flexbox for vertical and horizontal alignment
- CSS Grid for project layout
- Box shadows, borders, background, and gradients for design
- Explore color shades

### 1.3 JavaScript
JavaScript is used for interactivity and dynamic functionalities. Main elements used:
- Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- Contact form feedback (layout only)


## 2. Folder Structure

The project follows a clear and organized folder structure:

assignment-1/  
├── assets/images
│ ├── image_placeholder.png
│ ├── project1.png
│ ├── project2.png
│ └── project3.png
├── css/  
│ └── styles.css  
├── docs/  
│ ├── ai-usage-report.md  
│ └── technical-documentation.md  
├── js/  
│ └── script.js  
├── index.html  
├── README.md  
└── .gitignore

purpose of each folder:
| File Name | Usage |
|----|----|
| `index.html` | Main page (where the program should run in) |
| `css/styles.css` | For page styling |
| `js/script.js` | For functionality |
| `assets/images/` | Project images |
| `docs/ai-usage-report.md` | A detailed AI usage report |
| `docs/technical-documentation.md` | Technical documentation |


## 3. Portfolio Structure

The website is divided into main sections:

### 3.1 Navigation Bar
- Placed at the top of the page
- Contains links to major sections (About me, Projects, Skills, Contact Form)
- Includes theme toggle button (Dark/light mode)
- Uses anchor links for navigation

### 3.2 About Me Section
- Introduction, personal summary, and quick basic information about my university
- Message button to jump to the contact form section

### 3.3 Projects Section
- Displaying 3 academic projects:
	- Salary Prediction Classification
	- Peruke Game
	- Crime Forecasting in Los Angeles
- Each project card contains:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Image preview

### 3.4 Skills Section
- Organized into 2 categories: Professional and Programming skills
- Using chip-style elements

### 3.5 Contact Section
- Fields used: Name, Email, Message
- 'No backend connection'



## 4. Image Handling

Images are stored in the `assets/images/` directory and are displayed using the relative path:
`<img  src="assets/images/project2.png"  alt="Project description">` 
Each`.img-box` container ensures:
-   Fixed aspect ratio
-   Proper alignment
-   Consistent image sizing
 
 
## 5. JavaScript Functionality

### 5.1 Theme Toggle
-   Switches between light and dark themes
-   Saves preference using `localStorage` 

### 5.2 Contact Form Feedback
-   Prevents default form submission
-   Resets form fields
-   No backend processing

## 6. Accessibility Features

The website includes basic accessibility features (CSS Style mostly):
-   Alt text for all images
-   Proper form labels
-   High/low contrast in dark/light modes
-   Keyboard-accessible navigation
   
## 7. Performance Optimization

Several techniques were used to improve the overall performance and layout:
-   Optimized image sizes in each image container    
-   Minimal JavaScript usage (for now)
-   Avoidance of unnecessary animations



## 8. Testing and Validation

The website was tested using:
- Browser Testing
	- Google Chrome
	- Microsoft Edge
- Device Testing
	- Desktop
	- Mobile simulation 
- Functional Testing
	- Navigation links
	- Theme toggle
	- Form submission
	-  Image loading
    

## 9. GitHub Control

VS Code, Git, and GitHub were used for version control.
- Regular commits
- Descriptive commit messages
- Separate commits for major features
- Online backup through GitHub
